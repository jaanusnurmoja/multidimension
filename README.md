# multidimension

This app was created only for educational purposes - to give potential java Spring app some enhanced features, especially the ability to submit multidimensional repeaated data

You will find there two meaningless forms. One of them is a very simple and stupid 5-level data form which submit data into 5 related database tables. 

There is also an attempt to create some blog application with multidimensional submission forms. The concept is that the main blog record has only a title and little text area, 
but the whole text is divided into separate text paragraphs which could potentially be reusable.
